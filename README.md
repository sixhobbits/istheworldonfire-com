# Is the World on Fire

A list of ongoing "fires" -- disasters, crises, or other events that might stop you from living a "normal" life in specific countries.

Contributions are welcome - please do a pull request to the "fires.itwof" file and carefully following the existing format

* Two blank lines between countries
* Each country block can contain one or more "fires"
* Each fire is two lines: a link to a Wikipedia article followed by the title (which should also be from Wikipedia wherever possible)

No need to run the 'generate.py' script - that'll get done when the pull request is merged

License and contribution guidelines: I'll merge pull requests that follow the correct format and that I agree count as a "fire", otherwise do what you want with it, I won't sue you.

With apologies to istheinternetonfire.com.
